# Introduction

Pi Coin (Pi Network) is a digital currency project that was launched in 2019 by a group of Stanford University graduates. The goal of Pi Network is to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone by allowing people to mine coins on their smartphones without needing powerful hardware or complex mining setups.

## Key Features of Pi Coin:

### Mobile Mining
Pi Network allows users to mine coins on their smartphones, which makes it much more accessible compared to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which require high-powered computers and significant energy consumption. Users can mine Pi coins by simply pressing a button on their app each day.

### Decentralization
Pi Network aims to create a decentralized network by encouraging people to join and participate. The networkâ€™s consensus algorithm is built on a structure known as the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which is designed to allow participants to validate transactions without needing a centralized authority.

### Phases of Development
Pi Network has launched in stages:

- **Phase 1 (App Launch)**: Users could start mining and building their network.
- **Phase 2 (Mainnet)**: The mainnet was planned to be launched once the network had enough users and was ready to handle real transactions. The project was expected to evolve from being a test network to a fully functional cryptocurrency.
- **Phase 3 (Open Network)**: This is the final stage when Pi will fully transition to a decentralized blockchain, and users can exchange their coins with others.

### Utility of Pi Coin
As of now, Pi Coin doesn't have any real-world value or exchanges available where it can be traded, as it is still in development. However, once the network reaches critical mass and the mainnet is fully operational, Pi Coin may be traded like other cryptocurrencies, potentially gaining real-world value.

### Community and Growth
Pi Network's success is largely driven by its growing user base, with millions of users worldwide. The network uses a referral system to encourage people to invite others, growing the community and increasing its security and validation process.

### Security and Trust
Pi Network emphasizes trust and security by relying on social consensus, where users with higher trust scores (based on their activity and connections) are more likely to help validate transactions on the network.
